  <h2>Welcome to the Leading University Debating Club</h2>
  <p>
    Founded in 2002, the <strong>Leading University Debating Club (LUDC)</strong> has remained committed to fostering intellectual growth, eloquence, and critical thinking among students for over two decades. As of 2025, LUDC proudly celebrates its enduring legacy of cultivating a vibrant culture of debate and dialogue within the university.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the years, LUDC has organized a diverse range of workshops, intra-university competitions, and prestigious debate events, while also enabling students to represent Leading University in numerous local, national, and international tournaments. These initiatives have provided invaluable platforms for students to sharpen their analytical and oratory skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    We invite all aspiring debaters and thinkers of Leading University to become part of our communityâ€”where voices are heard, ideas are challenged, and leadership is nurtured through respectful discourse and spirited competition.
